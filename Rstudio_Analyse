#=====================
# STEP 1: COLLECT DATA
# since i have merge all data in single file
#=====================
all_trips <- read_csv("all_trips.csv")
#====================================================
# Compare column names each of the files
# While the names don't have to be in the same order, they DO need to match perfectly before we can use a command to join them into one file
colnames(all_trips)

# Inspect the dataframes and look for incongruencies
str(all_trips)

# Convert ride_id and rideable_type to character so that they can stack correctly
all_trips <-  mutate(all_trips, ride_id = as.character(ride_id)
                   ,rideable_type = as.character(rideable_type))

# Remove lat, long fields
all_trips <- all_trips %>%  
  select(-c(start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng))

#======================================================
# STEP 3: CLEAN UP AND ADD DATA TO PREPARE FOR ANALYSIS
#======================================================
# Inspect the new table that has been created
colnames(all_trips)  #List of column names
nrow(all_trips)  #How many rows are in data frame?
dim(all_trips)  #Dimensions of the data frame?
head(all_trips)  #See the first 6 rows of data frame.  Also tail(all_trips)
str(all_trips)  #See list of columns and data types (numeric, character, etc)
summary(all_trips)  #Statistical summary of data. Mainly for numerics

# Begin by seeing how many observations fall under each usertype
table(all_trips$member_casual)

# Check to make sure the proper number of observations were reassigned
table(all_trips$member_casual)

# Add columns that list the date, month, day, and year of each ride
# This will allow us to aggregate ride data for each month, day, or year ... before completing these operations we could only aggregate at the ride level
# https://www.statmethods.net/input/dates.html more on date formats in R found at that link
all_trips$date <- as.Date(all_trips$started_at) #The default format is yyyy-mm-dd
all_trips$month <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%m")
all_trips$day <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%d")
all_trips$year <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%Y")
all_trips$day_of_week <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%A")

# Add a "ride_length" calculation to all_trips (in seconds)
# https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/difftime.html
all_trips$ride_length <- difftime(all_trips$ended_at,all_trips$started_at)

# Inspect the structure of the columns
str(all_trips)

# Convert "ride_length" from Factor to numeric so we can run calculations on the data
is.factor(all_trips$ride_length)
all_trips$ride_length <- as.numeric(as.character(all_trips$ride_length))
is.numeric(all_trips$ride_length)

# Remove "bad" data
# The dataframe includes a few hundred entries when bikes were taken out of docks and checked for quality by Divvy or ride_length was negative
# We will create a new version of the dataframe (v2) since data is being removed
# https://www.datasciencemadesimple.com/delete-or-drop-rows-in-r-with-conditions-2/
all_trips_v2 <- all_trips[!(all_trips$start_station_name == "HQ QR" | all_trips$ride_length<0),]

#=====================================
# STEP 4: CONDUCT DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS
#=====================================
# Descriptive analysis on ride_length (all figures in seconds)
mean(all_trips_v2$ride_length) #straight average (total ride length / rides)
median(all_trips_v2$ride_length) #midpoint number in the ascending array of ride lengths
max(all_trips_v2$ride_length) #longest ride
min(all_trips_v2$ride_length) #shortest ride

# You can condense the four lines above to one line using summary() on the specific attribute
summary(all_trips_v2$ride_length)

# Compare members and casual users
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = mean)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = median)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = max)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = min)

# See the average ride time by each day for members vs casual users
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual + all_trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)

# Notice that the days of the week are out of order. Let's fix that.
all_trips_v2$day_of_week <- ordered(all_trips_v2$day_of_week, levels=c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))

# Now, let's run the average ride time by each day for members vs casual users
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual + all_trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)

# analyze ridership data by type and weekday
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>%  #creates weekday field using wday()
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>%  #groups by usertype and weekday
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()							#calculates the number of rides and average duration 
  ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 		# calculates the average duration
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)								# sorts

# Let's visualize the number of rides by rider type
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")

# Let's create a visualization for average duration
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = average_duration, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
